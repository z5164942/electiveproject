# Background 

There is an abundance of misinformation about COVID-19 on social media. For example, some people speculate that the virus is a biological weapon, whereas others discuss fake cures such as vitamins and teas. This misinformation is fuelling unnecessary panic by causing people to hoard certain goods and it has also led people to underreact by dismissing the virus as ‘just another flu’. Given the power of information in guiding behaviour, it is important to understand whether certain interventions, like nudging, can deter people from sharing and believing misinformation. Previous research on political misinformation shows that encouraging critical thinking with nudging can help people identify false news and lower their likelihood of sharing misinformation. Given the current pandemic, exploring whether nudging strategies can be applied in a similar way to COVID-19 would be a way we could reduce the spread of misinformation.
