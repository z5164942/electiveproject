### Study Background 

There is an abundance of misinformation about COVID-19 on social media. For example, some people speculate that the virus is a biological weapon, whereas others discuss fake cures such as vitamins and teas. This misinformation is fuelling unnecessary panic by causing people to hoard certain goods and it has also led people to underreact by dismissing the virus as ‘just another flu’. Given the power of information in guiding behaviour, it is important to understand whether certain interventions, like nudging, can deter people from sharing and believing misinformation.
