# Background 

There is an abundance of misinformation about COVID-19 on social media. For example, some people speculate that the virus is a biological weapon, whereas others discuss fake cures such as vitamins and teas. This misinformation is fuelling unnecessary panic by causing people to hoard certain goods and it has also led people to underreact by dismissing the virus as ‘just another flu’. Given the power of information in guiding behaviour, it is important to understand whether certain interventions, like nudging, can deter people from sharing and believing misinformation. Previous research on political misinformation shows that encouraging critical thinking with nudging can help people identify false news and lower their likelihood of sharing misinformation.

# Study 1

Aim: do analytical thinking and scientific knowledge positively correlate with one’s ability to discern true or false COVID-19 news headlines and to share this information on social media? 
Two conditions: group that judged accuracy of news headlines (true vs false), group that were asked if they would share the headline online (yes vs no) 
Dependent variables: scientific knowledge, analytical thinking (measured on the Cognitive Reflection Test) 

# Study 2

Aim: does getting people to think about the accuracy of news headlines influence how likely they are to share true and false COVID-19 news? 
Independent variable: nudge group (rating accuracy of non-COVID-19 headlines at the beginning of study) vs control group
Dependent variable: likelihood of sharing true or false COVID-19 news (1-6 Likert scale)
